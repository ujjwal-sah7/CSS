        Web development is the process of building, designing, and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves both front-end development, which focuses on the visual and interactive aspects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development, which manages databases, servers, and application logic using languages like Python, PHP, Java, or Node.js. Web developers ensure websites are responsive, secure, and optimized for performance across devices. They also work with frameworks and tools like React, Django, and Express.js to speed up development. Overall, web development combines creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills to deliver engaging online experiences.
